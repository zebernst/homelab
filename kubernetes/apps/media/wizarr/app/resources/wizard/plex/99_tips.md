## 🎞 {{ _("Get the best quality") }}

{{ _( "Plex sometimes defaults to low quality or shows its own adverts first. "
      "Here’s how to fix that:") }}

1. **{{ _("Disable trailers & extras") }}** – Settings → Experience → untick *Show cinematic trailers*
2. **{{ _("Force original quality") }}** – Settings → Playback → set *Automatic* to *Original*
3. **{{ _("Use a wired connection") }}** if you’re on a smart-TV for stutter-free 4K.

## 🔔 {{ _("Get notified when your media is ready") }}

{{ _( "Overseerr (the media request system) is a type of modern web app called a PWA, "
      "the same technology behind web apps like Starbucks, Spotify, Sniffies, or Google Maps.") }}

{{ _( "You can set up native notifications by adding a bookmark to your home screen. "
      "This will 'install' the app on your phone, where you can enable notifications in your user settings.") }}

## ⚠️ {{ _("Report an issue with a piece of media") }}

{{ _( "While the automatic systems are pretty good at their job, sometimes a bad file makes it into the library. "
      "If there's something wrong with a piece of media (e.g. the wrong movie plays, it's in another language, "
      "there are no subtitles available, the audio is weirdly quiet, etc.), there's an easy way to let me know "
      "about it by clicking the yellow 'Report An Issue' button in Overseerr.") }}


*Happy viewing!* 🍿
